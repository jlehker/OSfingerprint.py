\section{Methodology}

\subsection{Packet Analysis}
Explain how packets have a specific structure based on the protocol.

\subsubsection{Window Size}
What is Window Size? Where is it stored in the packet? How did we use it to our advantage?

\subsubsection{Time to Live}
What is TTL? Where is it stored in the packet? How did we use it to our advantage?

\subsection{Implementation}
Talk about scapy and python here.
Go through code.
Lots of figures.

\subsection{Testing}
Explain how we tested it. Make a long (space taking) table of servers and their OS's

\subsection{Results and Threats}
This might be better as a new section. Not sure if we'd have enough content for it, though.
