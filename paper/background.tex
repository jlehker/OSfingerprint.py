\section{Background}
Start by talking about the attacker's process
\begin{itemize}
	\item Passive Reconnaissance
	\item Active Reconnaissance
	\item Exploiting the System
	\item Uploading programs
	\item Downloading data
	\item Keeping access by backdoors and trojans
	\item Covering tracks
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Passive Reconnaissance}
Explain what it's used for.
Give a scenario

\subsection{Legitimate Uses}
OS fingerprinting is an obvious technique attackers may employ to assist with nefarious activities, but these tools may assist with more legitimate uses.  Many high-tech companies use what is called ``Penetration Testing'' to discover possible vulnerabilities in their systems.  Tools, such as nmap, which provide OS fingerprinting options can be used to expose machines that leak information giving away OS type and version.  Security administrators can then modify these systems to prevent potential hackers from gaining information which can aid in an attack.
